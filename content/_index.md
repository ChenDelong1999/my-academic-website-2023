      ## **2023**

      ---


**[2023-09-01]**. I started my Ph.D. study at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/) at the [Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE)](https://caire.hkust.edu.hk/).
<br /><br />

**[2023-07-18]**. Our **`Diffusion-Conductor`** is awarded as Best Paper in [AAAI 2023 Inaugural Summer Symposium Series - AI x Metaverse](https://sites.google.com/view/aaai23-ai-x-metaverse/home)! The GAN-based **`Virtual Conductor`** proposed in my bachelor thesis is now upgraded to its diffusion-based version!

**[2023-06-30]**. Excited to share my latest work done during my internship at Xiaobing.AI -- **`Polite Flamingo`**! During visual instruction tuning of multi-modal LLM, we introduced a multi-modal response rewriter to address the degeneration of response politness, which is a typical instance of the *\"multi-modal alignment tax\"*. Many thanks my great mentors [Baoyuan Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/zjuwby/) (王宝元) and [Jianfeng Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jianfeng-liu-9539897b/) (刘剑锋) at Xiaobing.AI, and thanks [Wenliang Dai](https://wenliangdai.github.io/) (戴文亮) at HKUST!

**[2023-06-19]**. We annonce [RemoteCLIP](/publication/arxiv2023remoteclip), the first vision-language foundation model for remote sensing. RemoteCLIP outperform previous image-text retrieval SoTA by 9.14% mean recall on RSICD dataset and by 8.92% on RSICD dataset. For zero-shot classification, our RemoteCLIP outperform CLIP baseline by up to 6.39% average accuracy on 12 downstream datasets. This is a team work with many brilliant grad students at [AIM Group](http://multimodality.group/), thanks Zhangqingyun Guan (管张青云), Xiaocong Zhou (周晓聪), Jiale Zhu (朱佳乐), and Wenwen Cai (蔡雯雯)!
